“The two hardest problems in computer science are naming things, cache invalidation, and off-by-one errors.” - Leon Bambrick

The name data is a terrible, generic variable name, because literally all variables contain data. The same goes for naming variables var, which is a bit like naming your pet dog “Dog.” The name temp is common for variables that temporarily hold data but is still a poor choice: after all, from a Zen perspective, all variables are temporary.

Just as the smell of gas can indicate a gas leak or the smell of smoke could indicate a fire, a code smell is a source code pattern that signals potential bugs.

Print debugging is deceptively quick and simple. But it often requires multiple iterations of rerunning the program before you display the information you need to fix your bug.
